Good code. Not enough comments or docstrings.

Linear advection is a really important part of atmosphere and ocean modelling. No need to switch to the shallow water equations. Probably more work goes on improving linear advection schemes in atmosphere models than any other part of the dynamical core.

Good use of git with useful commit messages.

You should have a .gitignore file so that you don't add binary files such as .pyc and .pdf files to the repository

Well structured code. Clear with good use of dictionaries.

Not clear why you do
c = u/(dx/dt)
rather than
c = dt*u/dx

You should compare schemes with FTBS and CTCS. FTBS and CTCS should be used as the very simple naive schemes that you should aim to beat.

You should also implement one of the schemes from chapter 6 of the notes to show that schemes exist that can do better than CTCS and FTBS

Functions should always have docstrings describing what they do.

You need more comments in the file AdvectionSchemes.py

You don't need to do:
phiold[j%nx]
as j will always be between 0 and nx-1 because of how it is defined.

I haven't seen linalg.solve_circulant before. Looks good.

You could do:
phi = linalg.solve_circulant(q,phiold)
and then BTCS would not need two arrays for phi any more.

You will need to calculate more diagnostics analysing the behaviour of your schemes.

Also use the square wave initial conditions to compare how different schemes advect discontinuities.
